# Python REST API Container Project

## Backup-as-a-Service for 3D Asset Storage in the Cloud

This project was developed to strengthen foundational skills in Python programming, implement a RESTful API using Flask, and gain hands-on experience with containerization and cloud deployment strategies.

## Blender Python Addon

Throughout the development process, I acquired practical knowledge in scripting and extending Blender’s functionality using Python. Key learnings include:

- Structuring a Blender addon with proper registration methods and metadata using bl_info
- Creating custom UI panels and operators to enhance user interaction within Blender’s interface
- Utilizing Blender’s Python API to manipulate 3D objects and properties programmatically
